# classification the wine using dimension reduction pca and lda

In this project, I tried to classify 3 different wines, using wine content such as alcohol, malic acid. When I predicted the class of the wines, I used two different dimension reduction techniques which are principial component analysis (pca) and linear discriminant analysis (lda).
